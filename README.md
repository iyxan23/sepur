<h1><pre>sepur</pre></h1>

In short: It's a data format that supports fast access to specific keys, is highly efficient,
and is perfect for large datasets and performance-critical applications. Think of it as JSON
on steroids, but with a focus on speed and efficiency.

You could say it's similar to JSON in terms of flexibility, but its constraints are clearer
and the way it handles data makes more sense. Plus, it comes with an index at the end of the
file, similar to ZIP's EOCD, which allows for quick access to specific keys.

Currently, Sepur is just an idea. No code has been written yet, but I'm super excited about
the potential! Here's what's coming up next:

## The Plan

- **Design Time**

  First, I'll be focusing on designing how Sepur will work. The goal is to make it efficient,
  flexible, and easy to use.

- **Prototyping**

  Once I have a solid design, I'll create a prototype to test my ideas and see what works and
  what doesn't.

- **Coding**

  With a clear design and prototype, I'll start writing the actual code in Rust. Rust is great
  for performance and safety, which is perfect for what I want to achieve.

## How You Can Help

If you're as excited about Sepur as I am, here's how you can get involved:

- **Share Your Thoughts**

  Let me know what features you'd like to see or any challenges you think I might face.

- **Collaborate**

  If you have experience with Rust or data formats, I'd love to work with you!

- **Spread the Word**

  Tell your friends and colleagues about Sepur. I'm an introverted person, so it's best to have
  some friends to vent and cry out your problems with. (that was just a joke)

## What's Up With the Name?

Sepur is a Javanese word for "train". Since this is supposed to be a fast file format, so,
wooosh... a train.. yay?

## Streaming and Real-Time Data

One of the cool things about Sepur is that its structure makes it well-suited for streaming
scenarios. The data can be streamed in before the EOCD is written, making it ideal for real
time data processing.

## Get Started

Stay tuned for updates as I move from the idea phase to actually building Sepur. I can't
wait to see it come to life!
